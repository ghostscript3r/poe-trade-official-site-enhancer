# Poe Trade Enhancer - [install link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostscript3r/poe-trade-enhancer/master/poe-trade-enhancer.user.js)

Adds tons of usefull features to poe.trade, from a very easy to use save manager to save and laod your searches and even live search them all in one page, to an auto sort by real currency values (from poe.ninja), passing from gems max quality cost and more. I have some other very good idea for features to add, I'll gladly push them forward if I see people start using this.

***THERE'S ALSO A VERSION OF THIS SCRIPT FOR THE OFFICIAL POE SITE: [you can find it here](https://github.com/ghostscript3r/poe-trade-official-site-enhancer)***

## Features

* "Copy for Path of Building" button on every item result.

* Change quantities in currency searches freely.

## Please consider donating

If you like this script and wish it's kept working or wish new features to be added, consider contributing somehow.
Consider that by nature UserScripts need maintenance. I will never have any control on how or when the site I'm modifing will change. I try to develop theese scripts as smart as possible so that if anything changes they at least don't make the original unusable, but as the site changes the script will need to adapt to continue working. So if you find this usefull and wish to continue using it, really consider supporting me. If no one will, I'm pretty sure I will abandon theese projects sooner or later, and after that it's only a matter of time before it stop working.
You can donate on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=15819567) or [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=L5JZS33ADMBQW) and support me directly.
If not with a donation you can contribute by reccomending it to your friends, or even just by requesting new features or scripts, that might in turn attract new users.
Check my page on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ghostscripter) and follow directions from there on how to request new features or scripts.
There's already a specific page for **[requesting new features for this project](https://www.tricider.com/admin/36HWcTk5RhZ/DawSV0oQX7b)**.

## Issue tracking

[GitHub issue tracking page](https://github.com/ghostscript3r/poe-trade-enhancer/issues)

> ### Use only GitHub please. The other repositories section will be monitored occasionally at best. Also avoid sending bug report directly to my mail, there's a very high probability they'll just be ignored that way.

## Roadmap

<p>I’m glad to see so many people interested in this script! While I’ve kept the <strong>feature voting system</strong> and <strong>GitHub issue tracking</strong>, I’ll be honest—I haven’t been great at keeping up with requests in the past, and with limited support, that’s unlikely to change.</p><p>For now, I’ll keep working on this at my own pace, mostly adding things I personally find useful. I have some cool ideas, but they’re probably a bit too ambitious for a one-person side project.</p><p>That said, if you have suggestions, feel free to drop them in! Just know that new features will happen <strong>if and when I have the time and motivation.</strong> Either way, I appreciate everyone who’s found this useful!</p>

## About the author

> GhostScripter

I started enhancing pages using Userscripts (Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey) for myself and some friends. I always found very frustrating when a site I use very often makes me click around for tasks that should be done with one click. And since I'm a web developer discovering that I could easily enhance all those sites has literally opened a new world to me.
First works where crude but very effective in solving minor problems and unusabilities of various sites and apps.
Now I decided to polish and publish the most usefull of them and start taking request on larger scale.
Basically I want to fight frustration, a big monster that permeates the internet.
Basically if there's a site or web application with some annoying behaviours (5 clicks when you would like to do just 1, that sort of things), [try to ask for a new userscript here](https://www.tricider.com/admin/35BH7CcohrB/EFXf0Ei7SjR). It might be much easier then you think. Obviously patron and supporters requests will "bear more weight"... I do not guarantee that if you donate I will answer your request ASAP. Many factors will determine what to do next, like complexity of the request, prioritization of bugfixes, personal life, etcetera... But I'm pretty sure that any supporter request will be given a lot of attention. For this reason if you are a patron you would probably do better by directly writing to me at [ghostscript3r@gmail.com](mailto:ghostscript3r@gmail.com).
