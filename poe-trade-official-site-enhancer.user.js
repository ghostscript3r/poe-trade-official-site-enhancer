  <strong>Adds tons of usefull features to pathofexile.com/trade, from a very easy to use save manager to save and laod your searches and even live search them all in one page, to an auto sort by real currency values (from poe.ninja), passing from gems max quality cost and more. I have some other very good idea for features to add, I'll gladly push them forward if I see people start using this.</strong>

    I'd like to see some votes before starting on new features. I already put some ideas there, but I'd like to see more from you. If nothing appens there, the next thing will probably be a smart mod and ranges selector based on poe.affix values, because choosing a mod that gives no results because the mod for the type of item I'm searching is spelled slightly differente is one of the things I find more frustrating of this interface.

  <p>I started enhancing pages using Userscripts (Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey) for myself and some friends. I always found very frustrating when a site I use very often makes me click around for tasks that should be done with one click. And since I'm a web developer discovering that I could easily enhance all those sites has literally opened a new world to me.</p>
  <p>First works where crude but very effective in solving minor problems and unusabilities of various sites and apps.</p>
  <p>Now I decided to polish and publish the most usefull of them and start taking request on larger scale.</p>
  <p>Basically I want to fight frustration, a big monster that permeates the internet.</p>
  <p>Basically if there's a site or web application with some annoying behaviours (5 clicks when you would like to do just 1, that sort of things), <a href="https://www.tricider.com/admin/35BH7CcohrB/EFXf0Ei7SjR" target="_blank">try to ask for a new userscript here</a>. It might be much easier then you think. Obviously patron and supporters requests will "bear more weight"... I do not guarantee that if you donate I will answer your request ASAP. Many factors will determine what to do next, like complexity of the request, prioritization of bugfixes, personal life, etcetera... But I'm pretty sure that any supporter request will be given a lot of attention. For this reason if you are a patron you would probably do better by directly writing to me at <a href="mailto:ghostscript3r@gmail.com">ghostscript3r@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  If you like this script and wish it's kept working or wish new features to be added, consider contributing somehow.<br />
  Consider that by nature UserScripts need maintenance. I will never have any control on how or when the site I'm modifing will change. I try to develop theese scripts as smart as possible so that if anything changes they at least don't make the original unusable, but as the site changes the script will need to adapt to continue working. So if you find this usefull and wish to continue using it, really consider supporting me. If no one will, I'm pretty sure I will abandon theese projects sooner or later, and after that it's only a matter of time before it stop working.<br />
  If not with a donation you can contribute by reccomending it to your friends, or even just by requesting new features or scripts, that might in turn attract new users.<br />
  Check my page on <a target="_top" href="https://www.patreon.com/ghostscripter">Patreon</a> and follow directions from there on how to request new features.
